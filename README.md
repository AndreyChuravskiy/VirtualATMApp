# ATM Application
#### Overview
This project is a simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system written in Java. It allows users to interact with the ATM through a console-based interface, perform various transactions, and manage their bank accounts.

#### Features
Card Authentication: Users can enter their card number and PIN to access their accounts.

Account Management:
 - Check Balance: View the current balance of the account.
 -  Withdraw Money: Withdraw funds from the account.
 -  Deposit Money: Deposit funds into the account, with a configurable maximum deposit limit.
  
Blocking Mechanism: Accounts are blocked for 24 hours after three incorrect PIN attempts.

ATM Management: Tracks the total balance available in the ATM and ensures that deposits and withdrawals are reflected in both the ATM and client accounts.
